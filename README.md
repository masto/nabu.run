# nabu.run

This is the code for [nabu.run](https://nabu.run), a [NABU
PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NABU_Network)
"Adaptor" emulator written in JavaScript. It runs in a browser and uses
[WebSerial](https://wicg.github.io/serial/) to deliver software to the NABU,
as long as your computer has a suitable RS-422 adapter.
